                	<h1>St. Catherine's Center For Children</h1>
					<h2>Agency of The Month</h2>
					<p class="post-p">It started 127 years ago when the Daughters of Charity, an order of Roman Catholic nuns, purchased the Schuyler Mansion in Albany to create an orphanage for sick children. St. Catherine’s Center for Children evolved and now operates a child welfare program that includes a 25-bed group residence, a group home for eight additional children and a therapeutic foster boarding home program that provides care for 50 children. It has a series of prevention programs in Albany County and operates an “853” school for children with special needs. About half of the 68 students come from St. Catherine’s group programs and the rest are referred from school districts in the Capital Region and beyond.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="post-p">
                    However, St. Catherine’s evolution did not stop there.

“We are not just a child welfare agency,” emphasizes William T. Gettman Jr., who was named executive director in late 2011. “We are a multifaceted human services agency. We try to respond to the needs we see in the community. And we are very community-based. We believe that bricks and mortar don’t work long term for the children and families we serve.”

For more than 15 years, St. Catherine’s has run homeless services programs.

“We operate Albany County’s Marillac shelter for homeless families as well as community-based homeless prevention and supportive housing programs designed to stabilize families and help them stay in their own apartments,” says Gettman.

Late last year, the state Department of Health named St. Catherine's the Capital Region recipient for the Medicaid Redesign Team Supportive Housing Health Home Pilot Project. This innovative program is designed to engage Medicaid recipients whose homelessness or lack of stable housing prevents them from effectively managing their health care conditions and makes them among the most expensive users of Medicaid because of their high reliance on hospital emergency rooms.

                    <p class="post-p">
                    The award, one of only 10 across the entire state, not only recognized the quality of St. Catherine’s ability to reach out, engage and support the most vulnerable people in the community, but also placed the agency squarely at the center of the state’s effort to redesign its health care system—including the provision of community-based social services— based on managed care principles.
