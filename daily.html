Sheltering Arms will begin operating the site immediately and all participating families will continue to be served by the center.</p> 

<p>Opened in 2006, the Mother Hale Learning Center serves 45 children ages six weeks to five years, many of whom come from high-need backgrounds. Guided by the founding principles of Mother Hale – a nationally recognized humanitarian – programming at the site cultivates each child’s unique social, emotional, physical and cognitive development and helps them reach their full potential. The Mother Hale Learning Center is a natural fit for Sheltering Arms’ existing Early Childhood Education program, consisting of 11 centers that are widely renowned for innovation and results. More than 90% of children in Sheltering Arms’ Early Childhood Education programs meet or exceed school readiness standards by end of year, up from just 45% in the beginning of the year.</p>
